# Spectrum UXP Widgets


Spectrum UXP is designed to mimic HTML5 Web Components. This allows UXP to expose a consistent yet custom user interface without requiring a specific framework (such as React or Vue) while still encapsulating the implementation details.


In order to get started, you can just start using the Spectrum UXP controls as you would any other HTML tag. You don't need to include any special libraries â€“ they are immediately available in the global context.


```html
<sp-button>Get started!</sp-button>
```


It's that easy!
