## setup(entrypoints)
API for plugin to add handlers and menu items for entrypoints defined in manifest.
This API can only be called once and there after other apis can be used to modify menu items.
The function throws in case of any error in entrypoints data or if its called more than once.


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| entrypoints | `Object` | it consists of mainly three objects - 'plugin', 'panels' and 'commands'. |
| entrypoints.plugin | `Object` | This can be an object or a function. If this is a function, it is                                           assumed as the 'create' handler (described below). |
| entrypoints.plugin.create | `function` | This is called after plugin is loaded. 'this' can be used to access                                         UxpPluginInfo object. If 'plugin' object is defined, 'create' must be defined.                                         To signal failure, throw an exception. |
| entrypoints.plugin.destroy | `function` | This is called before plugin is unloaded. 'this' can be used to access                                          UxpPluginInfo object. |
| entrypoints.panels | `Array<object>` | This contains a list of key-value pairs where each key is a panel id (string) and                               value is the data for the panel whose type can be object/function.                               If a function, it is assumed to be the 'show' method (described below).                               If an object, it can contain following properties but it is must to                               define either of 'create' or 'show'. |

This function can return a promise.                                         To signal failure, throw an exception or return a rejected promise.                                         This has a default Timeout of 300 MSec from manifest v5 onwards.

| entrypoints.panels.customEntrypoint | `function` | Apart from the above default uxp panel entrypoints, Host Apps can define                                                   additional entrypoints to support custon lifecycle events. Details of the entrypoint like                                                   name, parameters passed, return type, etc. are defined by the host app.                                                   Currently, Photoshop hasn't defined any custom entrypoints.                                                   Xd has defined one custom entrypoint `update`.                                                        update entrypoint in XD is called whenever panel UI content should be updated.

For specifying a separator,                                         a value of "-" or menu item with label "-" can be used at required place in the array. |
