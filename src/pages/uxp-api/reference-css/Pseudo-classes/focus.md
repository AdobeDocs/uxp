# :focus

**Since:** UXP v3.0

Matches when the selected element is focused. An element is considered to be active when the element has keyboard focus.

**See:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus

**Example:**

```css
input:focus {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
```

## Quirks and Exceptions

* A typically non-interactive element must have a positive tab index in order to be matched by this rule.
