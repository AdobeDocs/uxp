# require('uxp').storage.FileSystemProvider
Provides access to files and folders on a file system. You'll never
instantiate this directly; instead you'll use an instance of one that has
already been created for you by UXP.



<a name="module-storage-filesystemprovider-isfilesystemprovider" id="module-storage-filesystemprovider-isfilesystemprovider"></a>

## isFileSystemProvider
Indicates that this is a `FileSystemProvider`. Useful for type-checking.



<a name="module-storage-filesystemprovider-supporteddomains" id="module-storage-filesystemprovider-supporteddomains"></a>

## supportedDomains
An array of the domains this file system supports. If the file system can
open a file picker to the user's `documents` folder, for example, then
[userDocuments](/uxp/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/domains/#module-storage-domains-userdocuments) will be in this list.

**Example**  
```js
if (fs.supportedDomains.contains(domains.userDocuments)) {
    console.log("We can open a picker to the user's documents.")
}
```


<a name="module-storage-filesystemprovider-getfileforopening" id="module-storage-filesystemprovider-getfileforopening"></a>

## getFileForOpening(options)
Gets a file (or files) from the file system provider for the purpose of
opening them. Files are read-only.

Multiple files can be returned if the `allowMultiple` option` is `true`.

**Returns**: `File` \| `Array.<File>` - based on allowMultiple is true or false, or empty if no file were selected.  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| options | `*` |  |  |
| [options.initialDomain] | `Symbol` |  | the preferred initial location of the file picker. If not defined, the most recently used domain from a file picker is used instead. |
| [options.types] | `Array.<string>` | `[&#x27;.*&#x27;]` | array of file types that the file open picker displays. |
| [options.initialLocation] | `File` \| `Folder` |  | the initial location of the file picker. You can pass an existing file or folder entry to suggest the picker to start at this location. If this is a file entry then the method will pick its parent folder as initial location. This will override initialDomain option. |
| [options.allowMultiple] | `boolean` | `false` | if true, multiple files can be returned (as an array) |

**Example**  
```js
const folder = await fs.getFolder({initialDomain = domains.userDocuments});
const file = await fs.getFileForOpening({initialLocation = folder});
if (!file) {
    // no file selected
    return;
}
const text = await file.read();
```
**Example**  
```js
const files = await fs.getFileForOpening({allowMultiple: true, types: fileTypes.images});
if (files.length === 0) {
    // no files selected
}
```


<a name="module-storage-filesystemprovider-getfileforsaving" id="module-storage-filesystemprovider-getfileforsaving"></a>

## getFileForSaving(options)
Gets a file reference suitable for saving. The file is read-write. Any
file picker displayed will be of the "save" variety.

If the user attempts to save a file that doesn't exist, the file is
created automatically.

If the act of writing to the file would overwrite it, the file picker
should prompt the user if they are OK with that action. If not, the file
should not be returned.

**Returns**: `File` - returns the selected file, or `null` if no file were selected.  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options | `*` |  |
| [options.initialDomain] | `Symbol` | the preferred initial location of the file picker. If not defined, the most recently used domain from a file picker is used instead. |
| [options.types] | `Array.<string>` | array of valid file types that the user can choose to assign to a file. |

**Example**  
```js
const [file] = await fs.getFileForSaving({ types = [ "txt" ]});
if (!file) {
    // no file selected, or the user didn't want to overwrite one they did select
    return;
}
await file.write("It was a dark and stormy night");
```


<a name="module-storage-filesystemprovider-getfolder" id="module-storage-filesystemprovider-getfolder"></a>

## getFolder(options)
Gets a folder from the file system via a folder picker dialog. The files
and folders within can be accessed via [Folder#getEntries](/uxp/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/Folder/#module-storage-folder-getentries). Any
files within are read-write.

If the user dismisses the picker, `null` is returned instead.

**Returns**: `Folder` - the selected folder or `null` if no folder is selected.  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| options | `any` |  |
| [options.initialDomain] | `Symbol` | the preferred initial location of the file picker. If not defined, the most recently used domain from a file picker is used instead. |

**Example**  
```js
const folder = await fs.getFolder();
const myNovel = (await fs.getEntries()).filter(entry => entry.name.indexOf('novel') > 0);
const text = await myNovel.read();
```


<a name="module-storage-filesystemprovider-gettemporaryfolder" id="module-storage-filesystemprovider-gettemporaryfolder"></a>
