# opacity

**Since :** UXP 2

Sets the opacity of an element. The value is between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).

**See**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/opacity  


## Quirks and Exceptions

* Photoshop 22.0.0 does **not** support this property, although UXP *will* parse it. Do **not** use this style to control visibility.
