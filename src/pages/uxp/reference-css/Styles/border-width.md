# border-width

**Since:** UXP 2, PS 22.0.0

Sets the width of the border.

**See**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/border-width

## Quirks and Exceptions

* UXP does not support the `content-sizing` box layout model. As such, the width and height of all elements include the padding and border width.
