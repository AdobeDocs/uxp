# :active

**Since:** UXP 3, PS 22.0.0

Matches when the selected element is active. An element is considered to be active when the user is actively clicking on the element. 

**See:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active

**Example:**

```css
p:active {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

## Quirks and Exceptions

* An element that is being right-clicked is considered "active".
* Double-clicking an element will cause it to be unable to be considered "active" until the double-click detection timer expires.
