# CSS Variables

**Since:** UXP 3, PS 22.0.0

UXP supports the use of CSS Variables, otherwise known as Custom Properties. This feature, combined with support for the [prefers-color-scheme](../../Media%20Queries/prefers-color-scheme/) media query makes it extremely easy to create custom themes that respond to the selected theme in the host application.
