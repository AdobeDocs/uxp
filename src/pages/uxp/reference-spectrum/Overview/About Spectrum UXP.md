# About Spectrum UXP

Spectrum UXP is designed to feel familiar to anyone who has used the HTML5 Web Components feature. This allows UXP to expose a consistent yet custom user interface without requiring a specific framework (such as React or Vue) while still encapsulating the implementation details. 

The version of Spectrum UXP shipping with UXP 4.1 is influenced by, but not wholly compatible with, the [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) API and the [Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) Design System. These incongruities will be resolved in future updates.

In order to get started, you can just start using the Spectrum UXP controls as you would any other HTML tag. You don't need to include any special libraries â€“ they are immediately available to the global context. 

```html

It's that easy!
